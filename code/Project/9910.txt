9910工程车的火炮达到了世界先进水平,但是由于火控和底盘等性能的落后,使其整体性能不高.后期虽然加装了新型装甲,但是离军方期望的程度太远,没有任何继续改进的必要.而随后出现的二代坦克改进型由于发动机技术,火控系统技术和装甲防护水平的进步,其整体性能已经与9910车相当,甚至在某些地方有超出,而价格更低更成熟,所以二代坦克改进型成了我国2010前的主力,在奥运安保计划中列为重点工程.

9910工程车完成后不久,三代坦克项目组大换血,充分利用现有成果,同时原先的技术短板有了长足的进步,三代坦克最终的“目标车”车型出现在"0910"工程中，由于二代改和9910工程中取得的大量技术成果和经验教训,仅仅用了5年既完成定型，整体性能达到世界先进水平


The artillery of the 9910 engineering vehicle has reached the world's advanced level, but due to the backward performance of fire control and chassis, its overall performance is not high. Although a new type of armor was added in the later period, it was too far from the military's expectations, and nothing continued. The need for improvement. The subsequent second-generation tank improved due to the improvement of engine technology, fire control system technology and armor protection level, its overall performance has been comparable to 9910 cars, and even exceeded in some places, and the price is lower and more Mature, so the improved version of the second-generation tank became China's main force before 2010, and it was listed as a key project in the Olympic security plan.

Shortly after the completion of the 9910 engineering vehicle, the third-generation tank project team exchanged blood to make full use of the existing results. At the same time, the original technical shortcomings have made great progress. The final "target vehicle" model of the third-generation tank appeared in the "0910" project. A large number of technical achievements and lessons learned in the second generation reform and the 9910 project have only been completed in 5 years, and the overall performance has reached the world's advanced level
