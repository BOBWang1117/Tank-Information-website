Leclerc T40是法国在2000-2010年间进行的一个项目，该项目深受俄罗斯BMPT系列的启发。其核心思想是以现有的勒克莱尔主战坦克底盘为基础安装一座轻型炮塔，创造出一辆坦克支援车（尤其是应对城市战环境）。T40是一种被设计为多平台通用的炮塔，曾经在SPHINX（斯芬克斯）、AMX-10 RC等平台上进行过测试。法国人的想法是让炮塔更加偏向于模块化——虽然无法现场转换，但是转换过程相对更快且可逆。车体来自2006年的勒克莱尔型号，即勒克莱尔Series 3。但是该项目遇到了许多问题，如造价太贵、实战例子少、甚至连它的学习对象BMPT都没有被俄罗斯人正式加入军队。然而今年胜利日阅兵上BMPT的出现意味着风向可能有变，因此勒克莱尔T40今后成功与否还有待观察。
车辆装备有1门40mm CTAS机关炮和2具二联127mm FGM-148G “标枪” 导弹发射器。开发组已经声明采用标枪导弹是游戏特色（现实中大概是法国MMP或MLP导弹）。


Leclerc T40 is a project carried out by France in 2000-2010, which was deeply inspired by the Russian BMPT series. The core idea is to install a light turret based on the existing Leclerc main battle tank chassis and create a tank support vehicle (especially to deal with urban warfare environments). The T40 is a turret designed to be multi-platform, and has been tested on platforms such as SPHINX and AMX-10 RC. The French's idea was to make the turret more modular-although it could not be converted on site, the conversion process was relatively faster and reversible. The bodywork comes from the 2006 Leclerc model, Leclerc Series 3. However, the project encountered many problems, such as the cost is too expensive, the actual combat examples are few, and even its learning object BMPT has not been officially joined the army by the Russians. However, the appearance of the BMPT on the Victory Day parade this year means that the wind direction may change, so the future success of the Leclerc T40 remains to be seen.
The vehicle is equipped with a 40mm CTAS cannon and two duplex 127mm FGM-148G "Javelin" missile launchers. The development team has declared that the use of javelin missiles is a game feature (in reality, it is probably a French MMP or MLP missile).
