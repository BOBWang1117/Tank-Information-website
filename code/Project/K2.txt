K2主战坦克，是韩国新一代主战坦克。
由韩国国防科学研究所(ADD)和现代汽车属下单位Rotem以及韩国其它的国防工业公司合作研制，使用外国和本国技术混合研发而成耗资2亿3千万美金，从1995年开始研发，据信是K1主战坦克量产后就紧接开始研发的。 韩国计划装备680辆，于2011年开始量产。负责开发K2主战坦克的韩国国防科学研究所(ADD)形容它是“全世界技术水平最高的”一种主力战地坦克”。
黑豹装有全新 1,500 匹马力引擎(K1引擎仅1,200马力)，由Doosan Infracore公司和 STX 引擎公司合作研发。路面上可以超过极速 70 km/h，越野可以达48 km/h。从0到32 km/h加速仅7秒，引擎也比其他同功率引擎体积小，允许设计成燃气涡轮引擎与美军M1主战坦克相同。三星科技设计此部分涡轮装置，使其可以再增加100匹马力，而在左边多出的空间又可安装一个补助动力单元，当引擎失效或停机时还能提供一些备用动力和电力。它还能使坦克停住时不必一直开引擎保持车上系统运作，达到省油目的;埋伏时也可降低音量和车温。
韩国 同时从德国引进了一批DM53穿甲弹，使用DM53穿甲弹时在2000米距离上可以轻易穿透680mm厚度北约标准钢板，由于德国对DM53穿甲弹输出韩国有数量限制，韩国还自己开发了K279穿甲弹，可在2000米距离击穿640mm厚度北约标准钢板.

The K2 main battle tank is a new generation main battle tank of South Korea.
Developed by the Korea National Defense Science Research Institute (ADD) and Hyundai Motor ’s Rotem and other South Korean defense industry companies, using a combination of foreign and domestic technology to develop a total cost of 230 million US dollars. The letter was developed immediately after the mass production of the K1 main battle tank. South Korea plans to equip 680 vehicles and start mass production in 2011. The Korea Defense Science Research Institute (ADD), which is responsible for developing the K2 main battle tank, described it as "the world's most technologically advanced" main battlefield tank. "
The Black Panther is equipped with a new 1,500 horsepower engine (the K1 engine is only 1,200 horsepower), developed by Doosan Infracore and STX Engine Company. The speed on the road can exceed 70 km / h, and off-road can reach 48 km / h. The acceleration from 0 to 32 km / h is only 7 seconds, and the engine is also smaller than other engines of the same power, allowing the design of the gas turbine engine to be the same as the US M1 main battle tank. Samsung Technology designed this part of the turbo device so that it can add another 100 horsepower, and an additional power unit can be installed in the extra space on the left to provide some backup power and electricity when the engine fails or stops. It also makes it unnecessary to keep the engine running when the tank is stopped to keep the system running on the vehicle, which achieves the purpose of fuel saving; it can also reduce the volume and temperature of the vehicle when in ambush.
South Korea also introduced a batch of DM53 armor-piercing projectiles from Germany. When using the DM53 armor-piercing projectile, it can easily penetrate 680mm thick NATO standard steel plates at a distance of 2000 meters. Because Germany has a limit on the number of DM53 armor-piercing projectiles exported to South Korea, South Korea has also developed the K279 armor-piercing projectile. Break down 640mm thickness NATO standard steel plate at a distance of 2000 meters.
