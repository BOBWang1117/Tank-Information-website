Palmaria是为满足阿根廷陆军对坦克的需要，发展了一种TAM中型坦克，第一辆和第二辆样车先后于1976和1977年在联邦德国制成。
动力舱前置的底盘便于通用化。对自行火炮为例，如果使用传统的，把战斗室配置在车辆中央的设计，至少要把弹药举到炮塔座圈的高度才可以进行装填。使用动力舱前置，带来的后部开放的空间也利于快速补充弹药
任何一种穿甲弹所穿透的路径大大增加。如果弹丸必须穿越传动装置或发动机，其动能就会受到损失。对乘员组的防护能力是有着（牺牲战车生存性为代价）的极大的好处。
后置的乘员舱可以配以设计一门蛤壳状门，使得装补充弹药和车组弃车撤离极为方便。在梅卡瓦的设计上，可以携带额外战斗人员。
Palmaria was developed to meet the needs of the Argentine Army for tanks. A TAM medium tank was developed. The first and second prototypes were built in Federal Germany in 1976 and 1977.
Taking the self-propelled artillery as an example, if the traditional design with the battle chamber in the center of the vehicle is used, at least the ammunition must be lifted to the height of the turret seat ring before loading. The main use of the power cabin, the rear open space also facilitates the rapid replenishment of ammunition
If the projectile must pass through the transmission or engine, its kinetic energy will be lost. The ability to protect the crew is a great benefit (at the expense of tank survivability). .
The rear passenger compartment can be equipped with a clamshell door, which makes it very convenient to load supplementary ammunition and evacuate the vehicle. In the design of Merkava, additional combatants can be carried.
