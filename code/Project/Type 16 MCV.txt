这是意大利陆军“半人马”轮式装甲车，装备105mm低后坐力炮。意大利军方希望装备136辆“半人马II”，以取代该车。“半人马”装甲车研制非常成功，制造了超过500辆，其中意大利陆军装备400辆，其余出口给西班牙和阿曼。2000～2002年，16辆“半人马”装甲车曾经借给美国军队进行测试。2012～2014年，俄罗斯陆军也曾经借用过两辆，分别配备105mm和120mm主炮的“半人马”装甲车进行测试。
2010年10月，意大利国防部与CIO集团签订研制新一代“半人马II”8×8轮式装甲车的合同。CIO集团在1987年研制的“半人马”装甲车的基础上进行研制。2015年以来，CIO集团制造了四辆“半人马II”原型车，并利用这些原型车进行了广泛的测试。
“半人马II”原型车采用了Freccia 8×8装甲车底盘，但采用了720马力的依维柯新型柴油发动机，比“半人马”的520马力和Freccia的560马力都要大。“半人马II”战斗全重为30吨，比“半人马”重6吨。车体长7.4米，宽3.14米，离地间隙0.4米，反坦克地雷在下方引爆时，依旧可以保护乘员的安全。
“半人马座II”采用了新设计的炮塔，以及奥托梅莱拉HITFACT II火控系统，整体采用铝合金装甲，重要部位使用复合防弹材料进行加强。炮塔内的三个乘员车长、炮长、装填手都配备了防雷座椅。
主炮为奥托梅莱拉研制的120mm/45倍径滑膛炮，具备更换105mm/52倍径的能力。这种主炮弹道低伸，有“胡椒瓶”炮口制退器和初速测量传感器。奥托梅莱拉专门研制了适用于这种火炮的120mm穿甲弹，可以在3000米距离上击穿600mm均质钢装甲，而105mm主炮则可以在同样距离上击穿480mm均质钢装甲。所有炮弹都储存在炮塔尾部的隔舱内。


This is an Italian Army "Centaur" wheeled armored vehicle equipped with a 105mm low recoil gun. The Italian military hopes to equip 136 "Centaur II" to replace the car. The development of the "Centaur" armored vehicle was very successful, and more than 500 vehicles were manufactured, of which 400 were equipped by the Italian Army, and the rest were exported to Spain and Oman. From 2000 to 2002, 16 "Centaur" armored vehicles were lent to the US military for testing. From 2012 to 2014, the Russian Army also borrowed two "Centaur" armored vehicles equipped with 105mm and 120mm main guns for testing.
In October 2010, the Italian Ministry of Defense signed a contract with the CIO Group to develop a new generation of Centaur II 8 × 8 wheeled armored vehicle. The CIO Group developed on the basis of the "Centaur" armored vehicle developed in 1987. Since 2015, the CIO Group has manufactured four "Centaur II" prototype cars and used them to conduct extensive tests.
The "Centaur II" prototype uses the Freccia 8 × 8 armored chassis, but uses a new 720-horsepower Iveco diesel engine, which is larger than the 520-horsepower of the "Centaur" and the 560-horsepower of Freccia. The total weight of the Centaur II battle is 30 tons, which is 6 tons heavier than the Centaur. The body is 7.4 meters long, 3.14 meters wide, and 0.4 meters above ground. When anti-tank mines detonate below, they can still protect the safety of the occupants.
"Centaur II" uses a newly designed turret, and Otto Melera HITFACT II fire control system, the overall use of aluminum alloy armor, important parts are reinforced with composite bulletproof materials. The three crew captains, gunners, and loader in the turret are equipped with lightning protection seats.
The main gun is a 120mm / 45 double-diameter smoothbore gun developed by Otto Melera, with the ability to replace 105mm / 52 double-diameter. This main gun has a low extension, with a "pepper bottle" muzzle brake and a muzzle velocity sensor. Automela specially developed a 120mm armor-piercing projectile suitable for this artillery, which can penetrate 600mm homogeneous steel armor at a distance of 3000 meters, while a 105mm main gun can penetrate 480mm homogeneous steel armor at the same distance. All shells are stored in the compartment at the rear of the turret.
