AS21是从韩国另一款步兵战车K21的下阶段改良型，现在K21服役于韩国陆军。而AS21提供更强的保护力，可以抵御炮弹和地雷威胁，而且拥有更大的内部装载量，至少能乘坐8名步兵和3名操纵员(驾驶、车长、炮手)。
K21的总体布局似乎与德国制造的KF41非常相似，都采用楔型炮塔，40公厘机炮的炮管也做了楔型外罩。KF41在2018年6月的国际防务展欧洲展览会期间亮相。除了40机炮外，还有一具7.62厘米同轴机枪，和一座安装在炮塔顶部的12.7公厘机枪，炮塔后方似乎还留有安装反战车飞弹发射器的模组。
AS21还将配备APS（主动防护系统），防止贯穿力极强的反战车飞弹

AS21 is a modified version of another K21 infantry fighting vehicle from South Korea. Now K21 is in service with the Korean Army. The AS21 provides stronger protection, can withstand the threat of artillery shells and mines, and has a larger internal load, can ride at least 8 infantry and 3 operators (driving, captain, gunner).
The overall layout of the K21 seems to be very similar to the KF41 made in Germany. They all use a wedge-shaped turret. The barrel of the 40-mm machine gun also has a wedge-shaped cover. KF41 was unveiled during the European Exhibition of the International Defence Exhibition in June 2018. In addition to the 40 machine gun, there is a 7.62 cm coaxial machine gun, and a 12.7 mm machine gun mounted on the top of the turret. There seems to be a module behind the anti-tank missile launcher behind the turret.
AS21 will also be equipped with APS (active protection system) to prevent anti-tank missiles with very strong penetration
